**AI Coding Workflow Starter Kit for Jules** is a GitHub-native starter kit for leading Jules through issues, pull requests, reviews, CI, case studies, and controlled automation.

It is built for maintainers who want AI-assisted work to leave a clean engineering history:

```mermaid

    Issue --> Task[Jules task]
    Task --> PR[Pull request]
    PR --> CI
    CI --> Review[Human review]
    Review --> Merge
    Review -.->|Request changes| Task
```

This is not a prompt dump. It is a reusable workflow kit with templates, examples, review checklists, CI gates, and case studies.

## What You Get

- scoped GitHub Issue templates for Jules tasks
- PR templates that require linked issues and validation notes
- maintainer review examples for approving or requesting changes
- lightweight CI checks for Markdown, YAML, and required starter kit files
- workflow levels from human-led work to sandbox-only automation experiments
- prompts for issue handoff and daily maintainer reports
- case studies showing how the workflow applies to real projects

The core idea is simple:

> A human maintainer leads an AI coding agent through normal GitHub engineering practice.

Not:

> AI built the whole project by itself.

## Start Here

**[Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart.md)** (for a step-by-step onboarding)

### 1. Copy the Starter Kit Files

Start with these files in your own repository:

```text
AGENTS.md
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
.github/workflows/docs-and-templates.yml
prompts/
examples/
```

### 2. Open a Small Issue

Good issue:

```text
Add a PR template that requires a linked issue, validation steps, and a reviewer checklist.
```

Bad issue:

```text
Improve the project.
```

### 3. Hand the Issue to Jules

Use the issue as the source of truth. Jules should produce a focused PR, not replace the issue.

### 4. Review Before Merge

Before merging, check:

- Does the PR solve the linked issue?
- Is the scope controlled?
- Are unrelated files changed?
- Are tests or validation steps included?
- Does CI pass?
- Would another developer understand this history later?

## Workflow Levels

This starter kit separates stable maintainer workflows from experimental automation.

| Level | Workflow | Human role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Human-led Jules workflow | creates issue, reviews PR, merges | recommended default |
| 2 | Semi-autonomous Jules workflow | creates issue, reviews final PR | practical advanced mode |
| 3 | Human issue only | writes issue; Jules handles implementation and PR updates | advanced with strict CI |
| 4 | Daily agentic maintainer loop | steers direction from daily reports | advanced planning loop |
| 5 | No-human sandbox workflow | observes or audits only | experiment only |
| 6 | Jules + evaluator-driven evolution | defines objective/evaluator and reviews result | experiment only |

The default workflow is Level 1. Levels 5 and 6 belong in sandboxes, not unprotected production branches.

## Case Studies

### [Case Study A: Digital Logic Circuit](./docs/case-studies/digital-logic-circuit.md)

Repository: <https://github.com/hkimw-underground/digital-logic-circuit>

A real hardware/software capstone case study showing how planning and implementation can move into GitHub Issues, PRs, human review, and Jules-assisted implementation.

The maintainer owns architecture, hardware constraints, scope, review, and final merge decisions.

### [Case Study B: English-Only Open Source Project](./docs/case-studies/english-only-project.md)

Status: planned.

A planned English-only case study for a global audience. It will demonstrate the same workflow outside a school/capstone context: small issues, focused Jules PRs, CI-first development, and readable review comments.

## Safety Position

This repository supports automation, but it does not treat automation as the default goal.

Stable guidance:

```text
Human decides direction.
Human owns architecture.
Human reviews final changes.
CI gates every merge.
Jules is never presented as a human contributor.
```

Experimental guidance:

```text
No-human workflows must run in sandbox repos or protected branches.
Auto-merge requires strict CI and branch protection.
Evaluator-driven evolution must use measurable tests or benchmarks.
```

---

## Why This Exists

Most AI coding demos show only the final code.

This project shows the process:

```text
Issue.
Prompt.
Plan.
Pull request.
Review.
CI.
History.
```

That is where real AI-assisted engineering happens.
